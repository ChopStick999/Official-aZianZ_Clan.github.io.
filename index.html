<p>Lately, you might have heard comments about the aZianZ_Clan and well you know it, we are going to talk about them today. With over a 100 wins on mobile is the mobile god himself , ChopStick. Rumors have lately come saying he is the owner of the aZianZ_Clan but what he says might surprise you, “Me and HudzPud both have equal power” but is that really true? HudzPud over here is a nintendo switch god and he also plays on PC. Both co-owners play on PC but other devices are their thing. Rumors came in from one of the members from the TSO clan that RibStar21 beat HudzPud in a 1v1. ChopSticks over here has only been defeated once in a 1v1 by HudzPud while playing on PC. While more reports come in, the aZianZ_Clan reigns supreme with more than 200 wins combined (all members), which is more than the TSO clan. Gossip came in and over on the TSO clan, there are emotional problems for RibStar 21 but not lil dady3. Over a month ago, ChopSticks beat lil dady3, 7-5 kills in a 1v1. ChopSticks noscoped lil dady3 TWO times while he was inside an ATK and also bet. The whole item shop was on the line, yet lil dady3 lost, meaning he owes the whole item shop. ChopSticks said that lil dady3 might be transferring from the TSO clan to the aZianZ_Clan although lil dady3 is not Asian. Going back to HudzPud, he carried The Sleep Rex to her first win! HudzPud also carried RibStar21 to his first win! The Sleep Rex seems to not be in a clan for she is probably a lone wolf. HudzPud seems to be on the same level on ChopStick yet the TSO clan is far worse than the aZianZ_Clan. With a new member, the aZianZ_Clan is the highest ranking clan in the whole Shrevewood elementary school with only three members!
